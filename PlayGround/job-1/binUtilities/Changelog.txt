===========================
Ver. 1.2 (10-05-2012)
===========================
.: The mean pT value is now outputted together with the flow data to avoid searching for the correct bin during the calculation for efficiency. The code now also handles the standard deviation together with the mean value, and for flows the code now outputs the corresponding data format file for easy read-in processes.

===========================
Ver. 1.1 (10-05-2012)
===========================
.: SingleVarBin.decideBin rewritten to separate the case where the bin in uniform, to avoid using numpy.searchsorted to increase efficiency.

===========================
Ver. 1.0 (10-05-2012)
===========================
.: Fastest implementation of the first version
